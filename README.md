# heston_model
Motivation
The Black-Scholes model for asset price assumes a constant volatility. 
![equation] (https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;dS_t=\mu&space;S_t\;dt&plus;\sigma\;S_t\;dW_t)
Volatility changes over time (volatility clustering)

Option prices show implied volatility smiles/skews

Returns are not normally distributed â€” they have fat tails and skew 

The Heston model was introduced to capture stochastic volatility, providing a more realistic framework for modeling asset prices and pricing options.
