Motivation
The Black-Scholes model for asset price assumes a constant volatility.

Volatility changes over time (volatility clustering)

Option prices show implied volatility smiles/skews

Returns are not normally distributed â€” they have fat tails and skew 

The Heston model was introduced to capture stochastic volatility, providing a more realistic framework for modeling asset prices and pricing options.
